# 3D_Face_Recognition

Testing data:
1) 12 3D facial surface meshes (2 females, 2 males; 3 surfaces each subject) with feature
point information from Texas 3D Face Recognition Database [6,7].

# Software library:

* Implementation of canonical multidimensional scaling and generalized multidimensional scaling algorithms in Matlab is provided in the package (Matlab source code package is only runnable in 32-bit Matlab systems).
* Mesh data is in Matlab format. A routine to load and display each surface in the Matlab is provided in the package. Dataset in the obj format is provided upon request. A free obj file viewer can be downloaded from http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/.
